                            the death penalty? Leela's gonna kill me. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be

                            of God, don't not do it! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>

                            Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. One hundred
                            dollars. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Enough about your
